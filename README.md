# Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Global Planning and Hierarchical Execution (GoalAct)

![image-20250316233231259](./framework.png)

## ðŸŽ¯ Intro
Intelligent agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in real-world applications. However, existing agent frameworks still face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting their effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning methods often lack clear global goalsâ€”leading agents to become stuck locallyâ€”or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution mechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited action space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To address these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that introduces a continuously updated **global planning** mechanism and integrates a **hierarchical execution** strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into high-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby reducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across diverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark that has no risk of data leakage and requires external legal knowledge for task completion. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate. These findings highlight GoalActâ€™s potential to drive the development of more advanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex real-world applications.
